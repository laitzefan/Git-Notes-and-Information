COMMANDS

1. git clone: command one, that pulls from repository
	> use this to copy the address of the respos so that your code and GitHub can refer to the same location

2. git status: command two, shows us difference between us and Github
	> use to check status on things

3. git add: adds new files
	> bc files on your com are not synced up to GitHub yet
	> to update changes: git add -A

4. git commit -m "added index.html"
	> records changes
	> "-m" part is optional (git commit); it's to make note of what the specific change was

5. git push: syncs up to GitHub

6. git pull: pulls down from GitHub
	> push and pull only work when you're on the directory of the GitHub repository
	> *** probably what you want to do at the start of each day, to see what changes have been made from day to day ***


	- you will do add + commit all day to edit/save
	- if you type COMMIT without anything changed and get that weird part that you can't get out of (git/COMMIT_EDITMSG or whatever), just:
		> hit ESC, then type ":wq", then enter
